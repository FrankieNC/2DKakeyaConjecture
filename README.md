# Towards a Formalisation of the Kakeya Conjecture in $\mathbb{R}^2$

Welcome to the repository for my MSc thesis in Pure Mathematics, completed under the supervision of Dr Bhavik Mehta at Imperial College London during the 2024â€“2025 academic year.  

The central aim of this project is the formalisation of the Kakeya conjecture in the plane within the Lean theorem prover. While the conjecture is trivial in one dimension and remains largely open in higher dimensions, the two-dimensional case was resolved by Davies (1971), who proved that every Besicovitch set in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has full Hausdorff dimension. 

This project mainly focused on formalising the existence of a Besicovitch set in $\mathbb{R}^2$. 

This repository contains the Lean code developed for the formalisation.
